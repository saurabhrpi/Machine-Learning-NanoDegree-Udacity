    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 1 |  C  | ----> one-hot encode ----> | 0 | 0 | 1 |\n",
    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_raw'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall** those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "** Accuracy ** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "\n",
    "** Precision ** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "** Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "`[True Positives/(True Positives + False Negatives)]`\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

I can see that it has the highest F-score amongst all the models, on a sample size of 100% training data set. I also see that the training and prediction time required by it is the least amongst all, virtually zero for all cases of sample sizes. Hence I guess this algorithm is the most suitable for the training data in question given the size of the training data, with its simple, neat and clean approach to problem solving. "

    "**Answer: ** First the data is divided into two sets - one without the income column, let's say X and the other with it, say Y. Now both of this X and Y's are broken again in two sets - one of which is used for \"training\" the model while the other one (also called the test set) is used to make sure the model is learning correctly.Now for each row of X in training set that is fed to the model the model is \"told\" what the corresponding Y value is. To be more specific, the for each cell in the table of X the model is told what is the corresponding label, in this case, whether the person belongs to >50K club or not. This makes the model form its own \"hypothesis\". Also, the model keeps a track of the column (feature) to which that cell belongs while learning the relationship, so that next time when it is fed a new value of the same feature it can assign that value to the same attribute while also learning the corresponding Y value. Now it's possible the model may have to form a new hypothesis while keeping its previous one too. This happens repetetively for all the values of X and Y. At the end which even hypothesis gets maximum number of labels right is selected by the model to be the final relationship between X and Y.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally the model is given only the X values of the test set and asked to \"guess\" or predict the corresponding Y values. Let's call these predicted values as Y-Pred. Finally we calculate how good our model has learnt by calculating how many values it has been able to identify correctly along with also penalizing it for any lables identified incorrectly."

    " - Example: `parameters = {'parameter' : [list of values]}`.\n",
    " - **Note:** Avoid tuning the `max_features` parameter of your learner if that parameter is available!\n",
    "- Use `make_scorer` to create an `fbeta_score` scoring object (with $\\beta = 0.5$).\n",

I tried a few different combinations of the parameters and found the given combination as the best one.  The results are what I expected. The optimized model performs the best as it is better tuned to the data than the unoptimized one and way better the benchmark predictor, proving the ability of ensemble boosting. The naive predictor is expected to have the worst scores as it involves no learning and simply predicts a constant (a positive label). "

A person employed in high paying sectors has a higher chance of breaking the required salary threshold than that in a lower paying sector. People who belong to developed countries are likely to earn more than those in not so developed ones. Anecdotally I have found that women are likely to earn less than their male counterparts."

    "Looks like I was right only about age. I didnt realize hours-per-week would be so important although I had an intuition for which I tried to check the given data but was not able to make a lot out of the returned number of rows. I guess it makes sense since people who spend more hours should earn more while those who spend less should be earning less.For e.g. less than 10% of all people who work for less than 30 hrs manage to earn more than 50k while same ratio is more than 40% for people putting in more than 40 hrs. Capital-Gain as expected should be directly proportional to the income, although I didn’t really expect it to be this strong with more than 90 % of people with capital-gain more than 6000 earning more than 50K while less than 25% of people with a capital gain of less than 6000 earning the same figure. Capital-Loss seems to be having the same relationship with income as the capital gain although little less so. This could be because capital gain and loss might be referring to the same group of people - the comparatively richer ones. Just that the ones with capital loss happen to be less fortunate with their investments. Almost 45% of people with losses more than 2000 have the required income threshold while less than 25% of those who have losses less than 2000 appear to have the same income. Certainly this kind of influence didn’t occur to me while I thought about this feature.  Education num seems to be behaving as expected with more than 25% of people with values more than 8 appear to have broken the 50K threshold while only 6% of those below that number seem to have reached the 50K mark. I wasn’t very clear about this feature and hence about its possible role in influencing the model."

    "How does a model perform if we only use a subset of all the available features in the data? With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "

    "Well apparently the scores have gone down as compared to using all the features. And it wasn't very fast. Looks like the difference in scores is bigger with the slightly less training time. So although I think the reduced features concept does make sense, in this case it would be better to stick with all the features since the data is apparently not big enough to cause any noticeable difference in reduction in time if all the features are reduced. May be in a scenario where the data was 10 times the given one it could have mattered. But not in the present one."
